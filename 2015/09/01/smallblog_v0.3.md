Smallblog v0.3 has been released. It is available on github [here](https://github.com/abyxcos/smallblog/tree/0.3) and gitlab [here](https://gitlab.com/abyxcos/smallblog/commits/0.3).

This release is suitable for general use.

## New features:
* Plugin support has been added. Place plugins in `plugins/`, and list them in the site configuration.
* RSS and tags generation are now plugins. These must be enabled in the site configuration.
* Various small code cleanups and improvements.

## Errata:

## Future:
* v0.3 will be the last version with new features. v0.4 will only address bugs. v0.5 will be a rewrite in a new language.
